Pyramid Auth Demo
*****************

Pyramid has the ability to handle complex authentication and authorization
patterns. How to do so is a constant source of frustration for new users.
This is a demo intended to showcase Pyramid's authorization capabilities.
A lot of the demo focuses on URL Dispatch. If you are interested in
traversal, do not despair as authorization via traversal is virtually
indistinguishable from the object-level security demo and all of the
concepts learned transfer over easily.

This demo is built around a wiki-style website that allows users to view and
create pages.
